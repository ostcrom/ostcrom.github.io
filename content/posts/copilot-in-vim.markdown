## Why Use Copilot in Vim?

As someone who frequently switches between scripting languages, I often need quick syntax reminders. Iâ€™d used GitHub Copilot in VSCode before and found it incredibly helpful. However, I prefer working in Vim, especially because it lets me stay in the terminal and keep my hands on the keyboard. 

I wanted to bring the benefits of Copilotâ€”AI-assisted code suggestionsâ€”into my Vim workflow to combine efficiency with smart assistance. This article assumes you are functional in Vim, if not please check out [this starter guide](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/classic-sysadmin-vim-101-a-beginners-guide-to-vim).

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, youâ€™ll need:

- **A modern Linux distribution** â€” Iâ€™m using Raspberry Pi OS (November 2024 release), based on Debian 12. These steps should work on most distros.
- **[Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim)** version 9.0.0185 or later â€” installable via your package manager or from source.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** version 20.0.0 or later â€” required for the Copilot plugin.

## Step 1: Install Node.js

The version of Node.js in Raspberry Pi OSâ€™s package manager is outdated (v18). To get a newer version, install Node.js using `nvm` (Node Version Manager):

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash  
\. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"  
nvm install 22  
```

This installs Node.js version 22 and ensures it's available in your shell environment.

## Step 2: Install the Copilot Plugin

With Node.js ready, you can now install the GitHub Copilot plugin for Vim by cloning it into your Vim plugin directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/github/copilot.vim.git \  
  ~/.vim/pack/github/start/copilot.vim  
```

This will install the plugin in the correct location for Vim to load it automatically.

## Step 3: Set Up and Use Copilot

To enable Copilot, open Vim and run:

```vim
:Copilot setup  
```

This command will generate a device code and prompt you to authenticate with GitHub. Follow the link below and enter your code:

ðŸ‘‰ [GitHub Device Authentication](https://github.com/login/device/)

Once authenticated, Copilot will be active in Vim. Start typing, and it will suggest code completions. You can:

- Accept a suggestion with `Tab` or `Enter`  
- Cycle through suggestions with `Ctrl + ]` and `Ctrl + [`
